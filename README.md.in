# RDFetch - a Rivendell Podcast Fetcher

RDFetch is an app that fills the RSS-feed-fetch void in Rivendell. Use
RDFetch to configure, retrieve and import audio from arbitrary RSS
feeds.

## Installation

Download the latest _rdfetch_ release from
[github](https://opensourceradio/rdfetch/release/latest).

Use the system package manager `yum`(8) to install and remove
_rdfetch_:

	sudo yum install rdfetch-<VERSION>.x86_64.rpm
	
where <VERSION> represents the version you have downloaded.

### Requirements

Installing from the RPM package will ensure all dependencies are met.

* _zsh_ (`yum install zsh`)

* _mysql_ client app (`yum install mysql-client`)

* _podget_ not from repo, from (CentOS 7 requires a version older than 0.8.6)
  [github source](https://github.com/podget)

* _wget_ (`yum install wget`)

* _@bindir@/zsh-functions_ also in this repo

* _@bindir@/podget-wrapper_ also in this repo

* all commands listed in ourCommands in _rdfetch_ and in
  _podget-wrapper_

* replace the placeholder %PODGET\_DIR\_CONFIG% with its actual value
  in _rdfetch_ and _podget-wrapper_
  (this is done for you when you install the RPM package)

* directory structure (where *$RDFETCH* is the "_home_" directory of
  the rdfetch app):

	+ *$RDFETCH*/configuration
	+ *$RDFETCH*/podcasts
	+ *$RDFETCH*/log
	  + *$RDFETCH*/log/archive
	+ *$RDFETCH*/tmp

* _$RDFETCH/configuration_:

	+ _msmtp.rdfetch_ Depending on the location declared in *$MAILER_CONFIG* in _notifyrc_.
	+ _notifyrc_ Set all variables appropriately.
	+ _podgetrc_ Set the following variables:
		+ DIR\_SESSION=%PODGET\_DIR\_SESSION%
		+ DIR\_LIBRARY=%PODGET\_DIR\_LIBRARY%
		+ DIR\_LOG=%PODGET\_DIR\_LOG%
	+ _serverlist_ Should be empty except for the comments. This is
      the where podget(1) gets its list of feeds to fetch

### Text User Interface Configuration

These tasks are performed for you when you install the package using `yum`(8) or `rpm`(1).

* Place _rdfetch.svg_ in _/usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/apps_
	+ run `gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/gnome` or `gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 /usr/share/icons/gnome`

* Place _rdfetch.desktop_ in _/usr/share/applications_

* As the "target" user, run:
		XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL=999 xdg-desktop-menu install --novendor /usr/share/applications/rdfetch.desktop

### Running

Invoke RDFetch either from the command line in a terminal window, or
by navigating to Applications > Rivendell > Configuration >
RDFetch. The menu leads you through adding, deleting (or disabling),
enabling, listing and otherwise managing the list of podcasts and
Rivendell dropboxes.
